# Agents

My collection of standards, skills, and rules for AI coding agents.  (WIP)

## Why This Exists

I work with Claude Code, Codex Cursor, and whatever else ships next week. They're all decent at writing code. They're all terrible at writing code *the way I want it*.

This repo is my attempt to fix that — a single place for engineering standards, testing guidelines, and reusable skills that I can point any agent at.

## What's Here (For now)

- **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)** — Core engineering standards. Language-agnostic rules for how I want code written, tested, and organized.

More coming: platform-specific standards, reusable skills, prompt templates.

## How I Use It

Drop the relevant files into your project or ~/.codex or ~/.claude folder.

Or just steal what's useful and make it your own.

## Philosophy

These aren't meant to be comprehensive or "correct" They're meant to be *useful*. Agents interpret literally, so the rules are explicit. They also love to skip steps, so the workflows are numbered.

If something doesn't work, I change it. If something's missing, I add it.

## Contributing

This is personal, but if you've got ideas or improvements, open an issue. I'm not precious about it.
